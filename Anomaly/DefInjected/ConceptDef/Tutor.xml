  <!-- EN: You must advance Anomaly research by studying unnatural entities.\n\nThere are two types of Anomaly research: BASIC and ADVANCED. Basic research projects progress when you study any entity; advanced projects only progress when you study advanced entities.\n\nYou can have a basic and an advanced project active at the same time. If no advanced project is active, advanced research will contribute to a basic project instead. -->
